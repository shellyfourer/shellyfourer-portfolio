        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Shelly — a <strong>multidisciplinary creative</strong> and <strong>software engineering student</strong>
            passionate about building things that speak to both the mind and the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            My background in fine arts, music, and theater/filmmaking has shaped the way I approach technology — not
            just as a tool, but as a medium for storytelling, expression, and connection. Whether I’m sketching out a
            user interface, writing code, or composing a visual narrative, I care deeply about how things <em>look</em>,
            <em>feel</em>, and <em>function</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, my love for math and science grounds me in logic, precision, and structure. This balance
            allows me to design systems that are not only beautiful and intuitive, but also robust and purposeful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe great digital experiences happen where creativity and clarity meet — where design is driven by
            empathy, and technology is human-centered. My goal is always to make something meaningful — something that
            resonates, solves problems, and leaves a lasting impression.
